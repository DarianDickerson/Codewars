All Star Code Challenge #26

All of Raj's once loner friends are now happily in a relationship. Even Sheldon!
Raj has hired you to manually change his group status to "In a relationship," so he can show it to his friends!
Create a function called missionImpossible() that takes a Group object as input that changes the "Raj" key, if it exists, to "In a relationship". The, now altered, object should be returned.

var wholeGroup = { Leonard: 'Married',
  Penny: 'Married',
  Howard: 'Married',
  Bernadette: 'Married',
  Sheldon: 'In a relationship',
  Amy: 'In a relationship',
  Raj: 'Single' }
missionImpossible(wholeGroup);
// =>
// { Leonard: 'Married',
//  Penny: 'Married',
//  Howard: 'Married',
//  Bernadette: 'Married',
//  Sheldon: 'In a relationship',
//  Amy: 'In a relationship',
//  Raj: 'In a relationship' }
Note: If Raj is not part of the input group, he should NOT be added to it.

    if("Raj" in obj){

    }
