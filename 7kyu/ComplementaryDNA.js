/*
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"
dnaStrand []        `shouldBe` []
dnaStrand [A,T,G,C] `shouldBe` [T,A,C,G]
dnaStrand [G,T,A,T] `shouldBe` [C,A,T,A]
dnaStrand [A,A,A,A] `shouldBe` [T,T,T,T]

function DNAStrand(dna){
    let mirror = []
    for(let i=0; i<dna.length; i++){
      switch(dna[i]){
          case "A":
            mirror += "T"
            break
          case "T":
            mirror += "A"
            break
          case "C":
            mirror += "G"
